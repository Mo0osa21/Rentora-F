## Background:

The website serves as a dynamic platform connecting property owners and renters. Users can browse through a wide range of available properties for rent, complete with detailed descriptions and images. Property owners have the option to list their properties on the platform, making them accessible to potential renters.

Renters can select properties based on their preferred dates and view the current booking status of each property. After renting a property, users can leave reviews in the comments section, sharing their experiences with others. This comprehensive functionality ensures a seamless and interactive experience for both renters and property owners.

Before we look at the user-listing relationships, let's look at the information we need to monitor for each resource.
